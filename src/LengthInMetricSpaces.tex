\section{Lengths in metric spaces}

On $S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, we define $\mathrm{d}(a,b) = \text{inf}\left( \{ \text{length}(\gamma) | \gamma \text{ is a path on } S^2 \text{ from } a \text{ to } b \} \right)$, where $a$ and $b$ are points of $S^2$.

\noindent Now we try to generalize this construction. We assume that $X$ is a metric space.

\begin{itemize}
  \item We will define \emph{lengths of paths in} $X$.
  \item Given lengths of paths, we will define a new distance $\hat{d}$ on $X$ as follows:
  $$\hat{d}(a,b) = \text{inf}\left( \{ \text{length}(\gamma) \ | \ \gamma \text{ is a path from } a \text{ to } b \} \right)$$
  where $a$ and $b$ are points of $X$.
\end{itemize}
