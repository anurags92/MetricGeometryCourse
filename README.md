Metric Geometry Course
====================

Lecture Notes for the course on Metric Geometry, including basic Differential Geometry, taught at the Indian Institute of Science, August-December 2013.

Topics in the course (so far) are:

* Metric spaces: examples and definitions

* Detective problem: From which spaces could these have come?

* Lengths in metric spaces.

* Lengths of smooth curves

* Length and Energy

* The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

* Energy minimization: Formulation of the critical point problem

* Critical points of the Energy in Euclidean space

* Critical points of Energy in the sphere.

## For contributors:

To start, clone this repository locally. This can be done easily on Windows/Mac using GitHub for Windows/Mac. These tools also let you sync with the server easily. Plenty of help is available on GitHub.

Please use the empty skeleton of LaTeX file already created for that topic. If you are new to LaTeX, you can use an online collaborative interface such as writelatex (which also has a nice tutorial).

To compile tex files into a pdf file, on Linux system type `make notes` in the terminal from the cloned directory. For any other platform open `Main.tex` in a Latex Editor and compile it (This works on Linux as well).

##Note:
The Latex sources should be in the src/ directory.
