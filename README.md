Metric Geometry Course
====================

Lecture Notes for the course on Metric Geometry, including basic Differential Geometry, taught at the Indian Institute of Science, August-December 2013.

Topics in the course (so far) are:

* Metric spaces: examples and definitions

* Detective problem: From which spaces could these have come?

* Lengths in metric spaces.

* Lengths of smooth curves

* Length and Energy

* The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

* Energy minimization: Formulation of the critical point problem

* Critical points of the Energy in Euclidean space

* Critical points of Energy in the sphere.

## For contributors:

To start, clone this repository locally. This can be done easily on Windows/Mac using GitHub for Windows/Mac. These tools also let you sync with the server easily. Plenty of help is available on GitHub.

Please make a separate latex file for each topic. If there is already a LaTeX file, edit this file. If you are new to LaTeX, you can use an online collaborative interface such as writelatex (which also has a nice tutorial).
